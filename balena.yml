  ## Usage instructions
  Once your device joins the fleet it will broadcast a wireless AP with the SSID raspi-webgui using the IP address 10.3.141.1.
  The administration interface is accessible from this IP with the default login credentials.
  It's important that after your first login you change these creditials in RaspAP's Authentication page.
  Clients connecting to the AP will be assigned IP address from DHCP range 10.3.141.50 â€” 10.3.141.254.
